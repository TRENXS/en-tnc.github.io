    <p>On this page, you can download the game. Although I highly don't recommend playing the legacy version as</p>
    <p>it isn't as good as the Remastered's demos or the full version, I recommend downloading either the full game</p>
    <p>or try one of the demos. But if you want to try the legacy version, it's an entirely different game with an outdated</p>
    <p>engine AND outdated broken code. If you want to try either the remastered's demos or full version, buy it and download.</p>
    <p>If you really want a crappy version of this game, try out the legacy version.</p>
